    <p><strong>Bio:</strong>
			Mads Hemming is a 24 year old is born and raised Copenhagen-er. 
			He’s very social and likes to have the occasional

drink and smoke with his friends. He loves all kinds of music

and going to a nice concert. Huset is a big part of his every-
day life and especially the music venues. He loves going to a

concert and has even played on some venues with his exper-
imental hiphop punk band The neverending Lemonades. He

plays the bass.
He is studying sociology at the university of CPH, but mainly
because his friends are all studying something and he doesn’t
really know what to do with his life.
He lives with his parents and is trying to save up to buy his

own appartment, but it’s hard because of his interest in fash-
ion and expensive clothing as well as his social life.

After school he usually goes to huset with or without some of

his friends, basically just to check in, because he feels com-
fortable being there.</p>
